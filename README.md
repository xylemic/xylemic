# daniel johnson

backend & systems engineer focused on understanding how things 
work beneath the framework layer.

currently rebuilding core backend knowledge from first principles  
HTTP, auth, databases, and working my way toward distributed systems 
and networking internals.

## what I'm working on
- HTTP server from scratch (no Express — core node.js `http` module)
- manual JWT implementation, rate limiting, middleware chaining
- raw PostgreSQL — no ORM, understanding query execution properly

## interests
distributed systems · networking internals · database internals · OS fundamentals

## stack
node.js · PostgreSQL · linux

## writing
documenting the process on Twitter → @[in_construction]
